Happy (pre-)Halloween! Just in time to create a few quick holiday
decorations, or to spruce up your notes/memos, comes MonsterParty -- the
latest font from yours truly, Mike Gaines. 36 monsters/images, from the
classic to the modern. Enjoy!

If you'd like to post this font on your site, be my guest; my only
stipulation is that both the Mac & PC fonts are available. (Trying to
promote a little cross-platform tolerance.)

The font is completely FREE, since I do not own the copyright to the
characters used. Please don't use the font to create commercial designs
(since you don't own the character copyrights either, I assume).

For the curious, the artwork was done in Photoshop, converted to
outlines in Illustrator, then imported into Fontographer -- where the
font was generated. The name is an homage to the late 60s animation,
"Mad Monster Party", created by the people who did thos Rankin/Bass
Rudolph animations you still see occasionally at Christmas time. I
encourage you to check it out....

Comments -- or bug reports --  on this or my previous fonts (TNGcast,
Xcast, Herc/Xena) alway welcome....
